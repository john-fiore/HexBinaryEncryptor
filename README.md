# Hex to Binary Encryptor

This is an encryption tool that translates hex code into binary code. I wrote this for my Computer Programming class on 10/30/2025. This tool is **not** intended for serious use, but more-so to mess around with. However, if you find serious use for it, be my guest.

Feel free to modify this if you'd like. No credit is needed, but it *is* appreciated.
